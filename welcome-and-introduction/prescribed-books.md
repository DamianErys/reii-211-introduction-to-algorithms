# Prescribed Resources

Effective algorithm design requires both a solid theoretical foundation and practical "war stories." These are the books that will guide you.

### The Algorithm Design Manual
**Author**: Steven S. Skiena | **Edition**: 3rd Edition

This is your main textbook. Skiena’s approach is famous for being "practitioner-first," focusing on how to actually solve problems rather than just proving theorems.

**Why we use it:**
* **War Stories:** Real-world examples of algorithmic triumphs and failures.
* **The Hitchhiker's Guide to Algorithms:** A massive catalog of problems and their solutions.
* **Clarity:** Complex topics made accessible for engineering students.

### Beginning C
**Author**: Ivor Horton | **Edition**: 2013

Although we have moved to Python, this book remains a high-quality reference for students interested in low-level implementation.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Contextual Use**
This is **purely optional**. Use this if you want to see how Python's high-level structures (like lists) actually work under the hood in a memory-managed language like C.
