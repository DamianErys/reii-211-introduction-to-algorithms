# Python Onramp

Welcome to the Python Onramp!

## What's This About?

You're here because REII 211 has transitioned from C to Python. If you have C experience, great! Python will feel familiar but more concise. If you're new to both, even better - Python is an excellent first language.

## What You'll Learn

This onramp covers everything you need to know about Python for this algorithms module:

- Basic syntax and data types
- Control structures (if/else, loops)
- Functions and scope
- Lists, dictionaries, and other data structures
- File I/O basics
- Object-oriented programming (light touch)

## How to Use This

Work through the Jupyter notebook at your own pace. The exercises are designed to build muscle memory - you'll need these concepts throughout the semester.
