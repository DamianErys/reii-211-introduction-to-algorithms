# Python Onramp

Welcome to the Python Onramp! Since REII 211 has transitioned from C to Python, this guide is designed to bridge the gap quickly so we can focus on the "meat" of the course: Algorithms.

## Choose Your Path

## Where Should You Start?

| **New to Python?** | **Python Pro?** |
|--------------------|-----------------|
| **Goal: Build a Foundation**<br>Work through the **entire** Jupyter notebook. Python is more concise than C, but the way it handles lists and memory is different. Don’t skip the basics. | **Goal: Verify Skills**<br>If you’ve used Python before, skip the explanations and jump straight to the **Problem Questions** at the end of the notebook. |

## Getting the Notebook

{% hint style="warning" %}
### Download from eFundi
The actual notebook file `PythonOnramp.ipynb` is hosted on **eFundi under Assignments**. 

**Why?** This file is updated regularly with new examples and fixes. Always ensure you are working on the latest version from the official portal.
{% endhint %}

## How to Get Started

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="1. Open in VSCode" %}
1. **Open VSCode** and press `Ctrl+O` (or `Cmd+O`).
2. Navigate to your downloaded `PythonOnramp.ipynb`.
3. When prompted for a **Kernel**, select your Python 3.12 interpreter.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="2. Running Cells" %}
* **Read & Run:** Click the "Play" icon next to a cell or press `Shift + Enter`.
* **State Matters:** Remember that variables defined in a top cell stay in memory for the cells below!
{% endtab %}
{% tab title="3. Experiment" %}
Don't just read. **Break the code.** Change variables, swap loop types, and see how the error messages differ from the C compiler.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Help & Troubleshooting

**Stuck on something?**
- Review the examples in the notebook
- Try running the code in smaller pieces to understand each part
- Ask questions during practical sessions

**Common Issues**:
- **Kernel not connecting**: Restart VSCode or select a different Python interpreter
- **Cell won't run**: Make sure you ran all previous cells in order
- **Import errors**: Make sure your Python installation is complete

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this onramp, you should be able to:
* Implement a logic gate in Python without semicolons.
* Understand Python's **list slicing** (you'll love this compared to C arrays).
* Write and call functions with multiple return values.
