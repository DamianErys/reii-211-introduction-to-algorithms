# Python Onramp

Welcome to the Python Onramp!

## What's This About?

You're here because REII 211 has transitioned from C to Python. All 2nd year students should have C experience, thus, Python will feel familiar but more concise.

## What You'll Learn

This onramp covers everything you need to know about Python for this algorithms module:

- Basic syntax and data types
- Control structures (if/else, loops)
- Functions and scope
- Basic algorithm implementation patterns

---

## The Onramp Notebook

### For Students New to Python

Work through the **entire Jupyter notebook** at your own pace. The exercises are designed to build muscle memory - you'll need these concepts throughout the semester.

### For Students Already Comfortable with Python

If you already know Python basics, **you only need to complete the problem questions** at the end of the notebook. These will verify you're ready for the algorithmic work ahead.

---

## How to Get Started

### Step 1: Download the Notebook

The Jupyter notebook file `PythonOnramp.ipynb` is availible under assignments on efundi.

### Step 2: Open in VSCode

1. **Open VSCode**
2. **Open the notebook**: 
   - Press `Ctrl+O` (or `Cmd+O` on Mac)
   - Navigate to where you saved `PythonOnramp.ipynb`
   - Select the file

3. **Select Kernel** (if prompted):
   - VSCode will ask you to select a kernel
   - Choose your Python installation (same one from the Hello World exercise)
   - If you don't see this prompt, the Jupyter extension should handle it automatically

### Step 3: Work Through the Notebook

- **Read each cell carefully** - explanations are provided throughout
- **Run each code cell** - Click the button next to each cell or press `Shift+Enter`
- **Complete the exercises** - Try them yourself before looking at solutions
- **Experiment** - Modify the code and see what happens!

## Notebook Structure

The notebook is divided into 15 sections:


Each section includes:
- Explanations and examples
- Code demonstrations
- Practice exercises
- **Problem Questions** (these are important!)

---

## What You Should Be Able to Do After Completing This

By the end of the onramp, you should be comfortable:

- Writing and running Python scripts
- Using variables and basic data types
- Implementing loops and conditional logic
- Writing and calling functions
- Reading and understanding Python code for algorithms

---

## Getting Help

**Stuck on something?**
- Review the examples in the notebook
- Try running the code in smaller pieces to understand each part
- Ask questions during practical sessions

**Common Issues**:
- **Kernel not connecting**: Restart VSCode or select a different Python interpreter
- **Cell won't run**: Make sure you ran all previous cells in order
- **Import errors**: Make sure your Python installation is complete

---

## Important Notes

- **Take your time**: This isn't a race. Understanding is more important than speed.
- **Practice makes perfect**: The more you code, the more natural it becomes.
- **Don't just read**: Actually run the code and modify it. That's how you learn!
- **Already know Python?**: Jump straight to the problem questions to verify your knowledge.
