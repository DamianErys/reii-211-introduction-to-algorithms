## Language Flexibility

{% hint style="info" %}
### The Python Transition
As of 2025, REII 211 has officially transitioned to **Python**. This change was made to allow us to focus more on algorithmic logic and less on low-level memory management.
{% endhint %}

{% flex %}
{% left %}
**New to Python?**
We have built a comprehensive **Python Onramp**. If you are coming from a C++ or Java background, you will find Python's syntax refreshingly concise. 
{% endleft %}

{% right %}
**Prefer C or C++?**
We embrace flexibility. While the primary lecture materials and examples are in Python, you are **welcome to continue working in C or C++** if you prefer the manual control those languages offer.

## How to use this Resource

* **Search:** Use `Cmd + K` or `Ctrl + K` to quickly find specific algorithms or concepts.
* **Deep Dive:** Look for "Additional Content" sections at the end of units if you want to see how these algorithms apply to real-world software engineering.
* **Feedback:** If you find a bug in a code snippet, please let your lecturer or lab assistant know!

{% hint style="success" %}
**Next Step:** Head over to the **Python Onramp** to ensure your environment is set up and you're ready to code.
