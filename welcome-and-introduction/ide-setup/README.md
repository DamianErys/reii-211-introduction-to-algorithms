# IDE Setup Guide

Before we dive into Python and algorithms, you need to set up your development environment. We're giving you **two excellent options** - choose the one that fits your workflow best!

## Option 1: PyCharm (Recommended for Python-Only Work)

**Best for**: Students who want a powerful, Python-focused environment with excellent debugging tools.

### Why PyCharm?
- Purpose-built for Python development
- Excellent debugging and testing tools
- Free for students with your university email!

## Option 2: VSCode (Recommended - Our Preferred Choice)

**Best for**: Students who want a versatile, customizable editor that will serve them beyond this course.

### Why VSCode?
- Extremely versatile and customizable
- Works for multiple programming languages
- GitHub Copilot integration available
- Lightweight but powerful

### A Word About AI Assistants (Like Copilot)

**Important Philosophy**: Tools like GitHub Copilot are incredible productivity boosters, but over-reliance can bite you down the road. 

**For this module**: Since REII 211 focuses on understanding **algorithms** rather than complex coding syntax, feel free to use Copilot for boilerplate code. What matters is that you understand:
- How the algorithm works
- Why it's efficient (or not)
- When to apply it

The complex syntax? That's a future-you problem. Your job now is to understand algorithmic thinking.

## Verification: Hello World Assignment

Once you've set up your IDE, create and run this simple Python file to verify everything works:

**File**: `hello_world.py`
```python
# TODO: Complete this file with:
# - A print statement saying "Hello World!"
# - Your full name
# - Your student number

# Example:
# print("Hello World!")
# print("Name: John Doe")
# print("Student Number: 12345678")
```

**Submit this file for participation marks!**
