# Unit 1: Introduction to Algorithm Design

## Overview

Welcome to Unit 1! This unit introduces fundamental concepts in algorithm design based on Chapter 1 of Skiena's "The Algorithm Design Manual." You'll learn how to think algorithmically, reason about correctness, and model real-world problems.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this unit, you should be able to:

- Understand the fundamentals of algorithm design
- Apply greedy algorithm strategies
- Reason formally about algorithm correctness
- Use induction and recursion as problem-solving tools
- Model real-world problems mathematically
- Construct proofs by contradiction

## Sections

This unit covers six key topics from Skiena's Chapter 1:

1. **[Robot Tour Optimization](sections/1-robot-tour-optimization.md)**  
   Introduction to the traveling salesman problem and algorithmic thinking

2. **[Selecting the Right Jobs](sections/2-selecting-the-right-jobs.md)**  
   Greedy algorithms and interval scheduling

3. **[Reasoning about Correctness](sections/3-reasoning-about-correctness.md)**  
   Formal methods for verifying algorithm correctness

4. **[Induction and Recursion](sections/4-induction-and-recursion.md)**  
   Mathematical induction and recursive problem solving

5. **[Modeling the Problem](sections/5-modeling-the-problem.md)**  
   Translating real-world problems into algorithmic models

6. **[Proof by Contradiction](sections/6-proof-by-contradiction.md)**  
   Using contradiction to establish correctness and impossibility
