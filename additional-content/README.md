# Additional Content

This section contains optional material designed to support and extend the core study units.

The content here is **not examinable by default**, but it is strongly recommended for:

- Practising algorithmic thinking
- Exploring ideas visually and interactively
- Working through extra examples and exercises
- Building intuition beyond formal proofs

You can treat this section as a sandbox: explore freely, experiment, and revisit it when a concept from the study units feels abstract or unclear.
