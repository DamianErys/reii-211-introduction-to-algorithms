# Heuristics Playground

This page links to an interactive, browser-based visualization used to explore heuristic reasoning on a 2D plane.

The tool allows you to:

- Place points manually using integer coordinates
- Generate random sets of points within bounded limits
- Experiment with heuristic strategies visually
- Build intuition for optimisation and approximation ideas

## Launch the Visualization

To open the Heuristics Playground, click the link below:

**[Open Heuristics Playground](https://damianerys.github.io/reii-211-introduction-to-algorithms/additional-content/visualizations/Heuristics/index.html)**

The visualization runs entirely on the client side.  
No internet connection or additional setup is required.

## How to Use This Tool

This visualization is intended as an **exploratory aid**, not a formal proof tool.

You are encouraged to:

- Try small, simple point sets first
- Change one parameter at a time
- Relate what you observe back to concepts discussed in the study units

There is no single “correct” outcome — the goal is insight, not answers.
