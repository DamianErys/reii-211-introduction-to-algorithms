# Algorithm Visualizations

This section contains interactive, browser-based visualizations designed to help you explore algorithmic concepts through hands-on experimentation.

## Purpose

The visualizations here are **not examinable by default**, but they are strongly recommended for:

- Practicing algorithmic thinking
- Exploring ideas visually and interactively
- Working through extra examples and exercises
- Building intuition beyond formal proofs

You can treat this section as a sandbox: explore freely, experiment, and revisit it when a concept from the study units feels abstract or unclear.

## Available Visualizations

### Heuristics Playground

An interactive tool for exploring heuristic reasoning on a 2D plane.

**Features:**
- Place points manually using integer coordinates
- Generate random sets of points within bounded limits
- Experiment with heuristic strategies visually
- Build intuition for optimization and approximation ideas

**[Launch Heuristics Playground](https://damianerys.github.io/reii-211-introduction-to-algorithms/additional-content/visualizations/Heuristics/index.html)**

### Scheduling Playground

An interactive tool for exploring job scheduling heuristics.

**Features:**
- Visualize film scheduling problems across multiple studios
- Compare different scheduling strategies (Earliest Start Time, Shortest Job First, Earliest Finish Time)
- Step through algorithm execution to understand decision-making
- Observe trade-offs between job count and time coverage

## How to Use These Tools

These visualizations are intended as **exploratory aids**, not formal proof tools.

You are encouraged to:

- Try small, simple cases first
- Change one parameter at a time
- Relate what you observe back to concepts discussed in the study units
- Experiment with edge cases and unusual inputs

There is no single "correct" outcome — the goal is insight, not answers.

## Technical Details

All visualizations run entirely on the client side. No internet connection or additional setup is required once loaded.
