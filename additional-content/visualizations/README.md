# Algorithm Visualizations

Algorithm visualizations are interactive, client-side tools that allow you to **see algorithms and heuristics in action**.

These visualizations are intended to help you:

- Develop intuition for how algorithms behave
- Observe the effect of different inputs and parameters
- Experiment without worrying about implementation details

All tools in this section run entirely in your browser. No installation or online services are required.

## Available Visualizations

- **Heuristics Playground**  
  An interactive plane where you can place points and explore heuristic-based reasoning and optimisation strategies.

Use these tools alongside the study units, not as a replacement for them.
