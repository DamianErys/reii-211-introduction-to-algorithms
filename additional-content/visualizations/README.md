# Algorithm Visualizations
This section contains interactive, browser-based visualizations designed to help you explore algorithmic concepts through hands-on experimentation.
## Purpose
The visualizations here are **not examinable by default**, but they are strongly recommended for:
- Practicing algorithmic thinking
- Exploring ideas visually and interactively
- Working through extra examples and exercises
- Building intuition beyond formal proofs
You can treat this section as a sandbox: explore freely, experiment, and revisit it when a concept from the study units feels abstract or unclear.
## Available Visualizations
The playground currently includes tools for **Sorting**, **Scheduling**, and **Heuristics**, with more being added over time.

## How to Use These Tools
These visualizations are intended as **exploratory aids**, not formal proof tools.
You are encouraged to:
- Try small, simple cases first
- Change one parameter at a time
- Relate what you observe back to concepts discussed in the study units
- Experiment with edge cases and unusual inputs
There is no single "correct" outcome — the goal is insight, not answers.
## Technical Details
All visualizations run entirely on the client side. No internet connection or additional setup is required once loaded.
