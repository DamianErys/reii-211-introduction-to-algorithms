## About This Course

Welcome to REII 211! This course introduces you to the fundamental concepts of algorithms and their analysis. You'll learn how to design, analyze, and implement efficient algorithms to solve computational problems.

### Important Update: C → Python Transition

This module has recently transitioned from C to Python (as of 2025). We've prepared a Python onramp to ensure all students are ready, regardless of their prior programming experience.

## Learning Philosophy

> **Understanding over syntax**: This course focuses on computational thinking and problem-solving. Understanding *how* and *why* algorithms work is more important than memorizing complex syntax. Use tools like AI assistants wisely - they can help with code, but the algorithmic insight must be yours.
