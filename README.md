# REII 211: Introduction to Algorithms
**North-West University | Faculty of Engineering**


{% hint style="info" %}
### Course Overview
Welcome to REII 211! This course introduces you to the fundamental concepts of algorithms and their analysis. You'll learn how to design, analyze, and implement efficient algorithms to solve computational problems.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Important Update: C → Python Transition**
This module has recently transitioned from C to Python (as of 2025). We've prepared a Python onramp to ensure all students are ready, regardless of their prior programming experience.

## Getting Started

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="1. Set up your IDE" %}
Choose between **PyCharm** or **VSCode**. Ensure you have the Python 3.10+ interpreter installed and configured.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="2. Python Onramp" %}
Complete the introductory exercises to get comfortable with Python syntax, specifically lists, dictionaries, and loops.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="3. Study Units" %}
Follow the chronological path through the study units to master algorithms one step at a time.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Learning Philosophy

{% hint style="success" %}
**Understanding over syntax**
This course focuses on computational thinking and problem-solving. Understanding *how* and *why* algorithms work is more important than memorizing complex syntax. Use tools like AI assistants wisely — the algorithmic insight must be yours.
