## Learning Philosophy

{% hint style="success" %}
**Understanding over syntax**
This course focuses on computational thinking and problem-solving. Understanding *how* and *why* algorithms work is more important than memorizing complex syntax. Use tools like AI assistants wisely — the algorithmic insight must be yours.
